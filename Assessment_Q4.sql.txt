--  For each customer, assuming the profit_per_transaction is 0.1% of the transaction value, calculate:
-- Account tenure (months since signup)
-- Total transactions
-- Estimated CLV (Assume: CLV = (total_transactions / tenure) * 12 * avg_profit_per_transaction)
-- Order by estimated CLV from highest to lowest
